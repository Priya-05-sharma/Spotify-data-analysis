In this Spotify Data Analysis Project I performed exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets. 
Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming platform with various features, including sharing songs freely and viewing the lyrics while playing the songs.
I've done analysis visualization and drawn insights with Python libraries and functions.
